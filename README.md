# A-Deep-Feature-Ensemble-Methodology-for-2D-Biomedical-Image-Classification
This is a research paper (CIPR-2024) based repo containing all the required Python notebook files that support our findings

The notebooks in themselves are sufficient for interpretations and understandability. However, the following points are to be taken note of.
1. The dataset we have used in the study corresponds to OCTMNIST and DermaMNIST published under the MedMNIST dataset. It can be downloaded using pip. Please refer [here](https://medmnist.com/)https://medmnist.com/
2. In the ensemble notebooks, make sure the paths are correct
